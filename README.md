# Xenia Canary Updater
Simple .bat file that updates the emulator.

# Instructions

Put the .bat file inside Xenia Canary folder, the same folder of the executable. 
Run it, press enter to update or close window to cancel. After the update, a log file will be created (or updated). 

Improvements must be done yet, like verifying the release date and updating only when a new version is available.
